# data-transformation-and-visualization-project

Hey Folks!
This is an End to end data analyst project from gathering data from Kaggle, through data exploration, assessment and manipulation using the pandas library in Python, to data visualisation in Tableau.
In this project i used Google Colab for my transformation and analysis of data using Python libraries like pandas and numpy, and I used Tableau Public for the visualization purposes.
The Dataset Link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset
Link to my Tableau Dashboard - https://public.tableau.com/views/londonbike/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link&:device=desktop

In this Repository -
london_merged.csv - The file downloaded from Kaggle containing the original dataset
london_bikes_final.xlsx - Excel file containing data after transformation in python
london bike.twbx - Contains my Tableau Workbook for the project.
data transformation in python.ipynb - Google colab Notebook containing the python code.

Thank You!
